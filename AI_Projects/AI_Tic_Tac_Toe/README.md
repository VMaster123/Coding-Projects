# Tic Tac Toe with AI Opponent

Developed a command-line interface where user plays against AI opponent at Tic-Tac-Toe
Implemented coding concepts such as AI Algorithms, Game Theory, and Recursion
Currently optimizing and upgrading AI Algorithm, and well as implementing alpha-beta pruning

# Base_Tic_Tac_Toe 
This is the regular 2-player turn command line interface game

# AITicTacToe
This is the one where you can play against the AI
