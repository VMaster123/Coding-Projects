These are code from tutorials that I noted down in an effort to learn Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, ML piping,etc.
Most of the code belongs to Youtubers in video.
This is to showcase intitative in learning ML
I do not take credit for any code in these sections or in the AI_Learning folder in general.
This is simply to track my progress and growth in ML and DL. 
I hope to comment everything once I have reached a certain level of understanind
