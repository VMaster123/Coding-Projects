Note that this code was example code I written down exactly, with very minor modifications, if at all from NVDIA Course Getting Started with Deep Learning
I did this to try and learn from the course by seeing the example of the code that they provide in an effort to showcase to the people taking the course how to use
PyTorch, Keras, NLP's, Augmentation, etc. 
I do not take credit for any of the code here, all credit goes towards NVDIA. This is simply here to showcase my initiative to learn Deep Learning.
I want to reiterate again, none of the code is my own, just simply took notes with it to learn from example about Deep Learning
Planning to make modifications and throughly comment code right now
